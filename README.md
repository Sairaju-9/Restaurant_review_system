Restaurant Review Dataset
------------------------

Description:
This dataset contains reviews for a restaurant. Each review has two attributes: 'text' and 'label'. The 'text' attribute contains the textual content of the review, and the 'label' attribute indicates whether the review is positive or negative. The 'label' is encoded as follows: 1 for positive reviews and 0 for negative reviews.

Data Sample:
